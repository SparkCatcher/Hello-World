<h2>Hello, My name is @SparkCatcher, and I love sheep!</h2>

<p>I just want to code a normal website on here with HTML, which I figured out, but whenever I write in the CSS <style> </style> tags anything i put inside such as font-family or float:right; doesn't work. </p>

<p>idk why it doesn't work!!!</p>
